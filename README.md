# nicholas_zakas
I'm a student. 
When I see some ECMA6 syntax and want to try to write it myself I write a bit in this repository.
The repo name is because I'm working my way through Zakas' 'The Principles of Obnect Oriented Javascript' (it's okay, it's ultra short) and his 'ECMA6' (much more interesting, much slower reading).
This repository holds several scripts of a dozen lines or so.
Name at github: https://github.com/atom-box/nicholas_zakas/tree/master
Name on local: code/zakas_ecma6

To do:  
ch3: practic getter & setter methods
ch3: read the 'freeze', totally alien to me since I come from Python and plain C
ch3: draw a tree in notes to summarize the end of the 'Objects' chapter
general: consider uploading some photos of summary notes from the NB for studying on the phone on the bus on dropbox/pdf.
