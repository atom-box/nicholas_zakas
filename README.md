I'm a student. 
This is where I see some ECMA6 syntax and want to try to write it myself.
I'm working my way through Zakas' 'The Principles of Obnect Oriented Javascript' (it's okay, it's ultra short) and his 'ECMA6' (much more interesting, much slower reading).
This repository holds several scripts of a dozen lines or so.
